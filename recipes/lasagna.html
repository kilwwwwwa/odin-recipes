<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that has captured the hearts and palates of people around the world.
It is a culinary masterpiece that consists of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, typically alternating with rich and savory fillings. One of the most traditional variations features a mixture of ground meat, often beef or pork, simmered in a flavorful tomato sauce. Each layer is complemented by creamy bechamel sauce, which adds a velvety texture and a touch of indulgence to the dish. Generous amounts of grated cheese, commonly mozzarella and Parmesan, are sprinkled between the layers and atop the final layer, creating a golden and gooey crust when baked</p>
