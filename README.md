# odin-recipes
my first web dev project

The ongoing project involves creating a simple recipe website using HTML as its foundation.

This is the main purpose of the project. As the website will be progressively improved, it will be possible to add interactivity and dynamic features by using CSS styles in this site as well as integrating JavaScript for more interactivity and dynamic features to provide users with a platform they can learn some food recipies
